              <H2>1. The service</H2>
              <p>
                Fitfo provides tools to import factual workout information from
                public TikTok and Instagram content you choose to share into the
                app, organize and schedule training, and log sessions. The
                service may change as we improve the product; we may add or
                remove features with reasonable notice when material.
              </p>

              <H2>2. Eligibility and accounts</H2>
              <p>
                You must be able to form a binding contract in your jurisdiction
                and meet the minimum age required by the App Store in your
                region. You are responsible for your account credentials and
                for all activity under your account. Notify us at{" "}
                <a href="mailto:nirv@fitfo.app">nirv@fitfo.app</a> if you
                suspect unauthorized access.
              </p>

              <H2>3. User content and third-party videos</H2>
              <p>
                You retain ownership of content you create in Fitfo (for example,
                logged sets, edits, and notes). You grant us a limited license
                to host, process, and display that content solely to operate the
                service for you.
              </p>
              <p>
                <strong>Third-party media.</strong> Fitfo does not claim
                ownership of TikTok, Instagram, or other third-party videos or
                posts. You represent that you only submit URLs or shares you are
                permitted to use and that your use complies with the platforms’
                terms. We extract factual exercise data (e.g. names, sets,
                reps, rest) and link back to the original source; we do not host
                or redistribute full video files as a replacement for those
                platforms.
              </p>

              <H2>4. Acceptable use</H2>
              <p>You agree not to:</p>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  Use Fitfo in violation of law or the rights of others.

                  Attempt to scrape, reverse engineer, or overload our systems.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Submit malware, unlawful content, or content you do not have a

                </li>
                <li>
                  Use the service to harass creators or misuse their content
                  beyond personal training.
                </li>
              </ul>

              <H2>5. AI-generated and parsed workouts</H2>
              <p>
                Workouts produced from video or audio are generated using
                automated methods and may be incomplete or inaccurate. They are
                for informational purposes only and are{" "}
                <strong>not</strong> medical, physical therapy, or professional
                coaching advice. You alone are responsible for how you train.
                Always consult a qualified professional if you have health
                concerns.
              </p>

              <H2>6. Subscriptions, billing, and refunds</H2>
              <p>
                Paid plans (if offered) are billed through Apple&apos;s In-App
                Purchase system. Pricing, free trials, and renewal terms are
                shown in the app and on the App Store at purchase.{" "}
                <strong>
                  Cancellation and refunds are handled through Apple
                </strong>{" "}
                (for example via your Apple ID subscriptions settings or
                Apple&apos;s &ldquo;Report a Problem&rdquo; flow), except where
                law requires otherwise. We do not store your full payment card
                details.
              </p>

              <H2>7. Intellectual property</H2>
              <p>
                Fitfo&apos;s name, logo, UI, and software (excluding your data)
                are owned by Vaayu Athletics LLC or its licensors. We grant you a
                personal, non-exclusive, non-transferable license to use the app
                according to these Terms. You may not copy our product,
                trademarks, or branding except as allowed by law or with our
                written consent.
              </p>

              <H2>8. Disclaimers</H2>
              <p>
                THE SERVICE IS PROVIDED &ldquo;AS IS&rdquo; AND &ldquo;AS
                AVAILABLE.&rdquo; TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, WE
                DISCLAIM ALL WARRANTIES, WHETHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING
                MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, AND
                NON-INFRINGEMENT. WE DO NOT WARRANT THAT THE SERVICE WILL BE
                ERROR-FREE OR UNINTERRUPTED.
              </p>

              <H2>9. Limitation of liability</H2>
              <p>
                TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, VAAYU ATHLETICS LLC AND
                ITS AFFILIATES WILL NOT BE LIABLE FOR ANY INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL,
                SPECIAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, OR PUNITIVE DAMAGES, OR ANY LOSS OF
                PROFITS, DATA, OR GOODWILL, ARISING FROM YOUR USE OF FITFO.
                OUR TOTAL LIABILITY FOR ANY CLAIM ARISING OUT OF THESE TERMS OR
                THE SERVICE IS LIMITED TO THE GREATER OF (A) THE AMOUNTS YOU PAID
                US IN THE TWELVE (12) MONTHS BEFORE THE CLAIM OR (B) FIFTY U.S.
                DOLLARS (USD $50). SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW CERTAIN
                LIMITATIONS; IN THOSE CASES, OUR LIABILITY IS LIMITED TO THE
                FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW.
              </p>

              <H2>10. Indemnity</H2>
              <p>
                You will defend and indemnify Vaayu Athletics LLC and its
                officers, directors, and employees against any third-party
                claims, damages, or expenses (including reasonable attorneys’
                fees) arising from your misuse of the service, your user
                content, or your violation of these Terms or applicable law.
              </p>

              <H2>11. Suspension and termination</H2>
              <p>
                We may suspend or terminate your access if you breach these
                Terms, create risk or legal exposure, or if we discontinue the
                service. You may stop using Fitfo at any time. Provisions that by
                their nature should survive (disclaimers, limitations, indemnity,
                governing law) will survive termination.
              </p>

              <H2>12. Dispute resolution and governing law</H2>
              <p>
                These Terms are governed by the laws of the{" "}
                <strong>State of Florida</strong>, without regard to conflict-of-law
                rules, except where mandatory consumer protections in your country
                apply. You agree that the state and federal courts located in{" "}
                <strong>Miami-Dade County, Florida</strong> have exclusive
                jurisdiction over disputes, subject to any non-waivable rights you
                have to bring claims in your home jurisdiction under applicable law.
              </p>
              <p>
                If you are a consumer in the EU, UK, or another region with
                mandatory venue rules, nothing here limits your ability to bring
                a dispute in your country of residence where required by law.
              </p>

              <H2>13. Changes</H2>
              <p>
                We may update these Terms from time to time. We will post the
                revised version on this page and update the effective date.
                Material changes may also be communicated through the app. If
                you continue to use Fitfo after changes take effect, you accept
                the updated Terms.
